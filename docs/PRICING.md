# FormWeaver Pricing Strategy: Student-Centered Template Marketplace

## Empowering Student Creators & Affordable Template Access

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-23  
**Currency:** USD  
**Mission:** Democratize form creation while providing student income opportunities  
**Model:** Template marketplace with creator revenue sharing (50-73% commissions)

---

## 1. Our Student-First Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Student Empowerment**: Every student can earn real income creating templates
- **Affordable Access**: High-quality templates at student-friendly prices
- **Revenue Sharing**: Generous 50-73% commissions for student creators
- **Low Barrier to Entry**: Free creator accounts, minimal costs to start
- **Social Impact**: Supporting student employment and financial independence
- **Sustainable Model**: Marketplace economics that fund operations and growth

### Why This Model Works

Traditional SaaS pricing excludes students and creators. Our marketplace model:

- **Cuts costs by 60%** vs traditional SaaS through shared resources
- **Creates student income streams** with passive template sales
- **Provides affordable templates** for budget-conscious buyers
- **Builds a sustainable ecosystem** where everyone benefits
